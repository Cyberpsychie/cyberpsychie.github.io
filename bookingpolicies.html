  <h3>Rates</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>Tattoo pricing is based on size, detail, placement, and time required. I offer both hourly rates and flat rates for smaller pieces. 
  Custom designs start at $X/hour, with a minimum charge of $X. To get an accurate quote, please book a consultation or send your idea through the contact form.</p>

  <h3>Deposit</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>A non-refundable deposit is required to secure your appointment and goes toward the final cost of your tattoo. This covers the time spent on your custom design and holds your spot. 
  If you need to reschedule, please give at least 48 hours’ notice to transfer your deposit to a new date. No-shows 
  or late cancellations will forfeit the deposit.</p>

  <h3>Waitlist</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>If my books are currently closed, you can join the waitlist to be notified when new appointment slots open up. Spots are offered on a first-come, 
  first-served basis, so be sure to include your tattoo 
  idea and preferred availability when signing up. I appreciate your patience and support—it means everything!</p>
